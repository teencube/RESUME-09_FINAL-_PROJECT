    <p>“I have just over a year of experience as a junior software engineer with First Technology. 
  In my short time there, I've already contributed to over a dozen projects and assisted with managing
   one project for one of the firm's long-time clients.
“Prior to this role, I completed a two-year internship with Mobile First, where I honed my mobile app
 development skills. Ideally, I would like to continue to specialize in mobile software engineering, an
  area where I know your firm excels.”</p>
